				query-plugin is composed of sample codes to guide basic usage of Query Service that supports easy execution of various functions such as execution of XML-based query statements through extension/use of Spring JdbcTemplate, mapping of query results into specific objects, paging of query results for each DB, 
				OR mapping, execution of Dynamic Query and execution of Callable Statement  
				and reference libraries necessary to use these open sources.

			  	Query Service is a service that enables DB data handling through input of query statements or objects. 
			  	Query Service provides an easy way to access data by abstracting the parts that carry out data access using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), 
			  	and reduces common errors that can occur when JDBC is used. It should be noted that since Query Service uses DataSource Service internally, 
			  	it should be deployed with DataSource service.
		  	</para>
			<para>
				All test codes provided in Query service manual are executed based on HSQL DB. 
				(Yet, CallableStatement and LO are based on Oracle 9i and 10g.)
