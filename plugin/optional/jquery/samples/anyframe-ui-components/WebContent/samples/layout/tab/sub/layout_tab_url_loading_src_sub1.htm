Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion.

The content for each tab panel can be defined in-page or can be loaded via Ajax; both are handled automatically based on the href of the anchor associated with the tab. By default tabs are activated on click, but the events can be changed to hover via the event option.
