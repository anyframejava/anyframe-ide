		<title> Introduction</title>

			<para>
				Util System Plugin is composed of sample codes to guide basic usage of util-system service and reference libraries necessary to use them.
			    Sample Application is provided in the web application which system resources can be checked can be seen at a look in the DashBoard type 
			    using the simpleweb-jquery plugin (jQuery UI Portlet) and the FusionChart Free service of the Chart plugin.
			</para>
			<para>
			
				To easily get information on System, Network, FileSystem, util-system service supports execution in the utility type by wrapping open source Sigar(provides information such as each OS system, file system, process as standardized API) 	
				And provides a structure to gather and access various system resource information through a single route of SigarAccessor.	
			</para>					
			<para>
			    Util-system service also provides the java compression/decompression function that uses the functions of open source Commons Compress 
			    and JDK through ZipUtil.
			</para>
			<para>
			 	System function processing through execution of Shell Script is also possible. When Sigar is not used, the procedures are usually required that extract wanted information by executing Shell Script (or simple system commands) for each OS through the exec method of Rutime and parsing the result 
			 	to process the system in the java environment. The ScriptExecutor function is included that turns those series of procedures into modules for reuse, 
			 	but the currently provided execution functions are limited to directory size check, memory usage check, and mac address and port scan information check.
			</para>
			<para role="introduction_title"><emphasis role="bold">Installation</emphasis></para>
			<para>Install util-system plugin by entering the following command in the Command window.
				<programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[mvn anyframe:install -Dname=util-system]]></programlisting>
			</para>
			<para>
				The installation result can be checked by the installed (mvn anyframe:installed) or the jetty:run (mvn clean jetty:run) commands.
			</para>
			<para>
				Util System Plugin gathers the initial system information through Sigar when the server is initialized, 
				and it should be noted that when there is no permission on the process being executed in the system 
				(e.g. system process of linux) or when a PC-based security tool blocks checking process information (e.g. Incops), 
				there is no problem in initialization and execution even though Sigar produces a warning message through a standard error output saying that access to the process is not allowed.
