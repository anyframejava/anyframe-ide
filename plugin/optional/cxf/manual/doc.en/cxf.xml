				There are various open source frameworks often used for implementation of web services including Apache CXF, Apache Axis/Axis2 and Spring Web Services.

		  		Web services provides wanted information and services anytime and anywhere and plays the role as a connection that overcomes the differences in communication between very flexible and heterogeneous operating systems and programs
		  		by defining the standards for exchanged data, not giving a perfect definition as other existing software does.

    		<programlisting>"A Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine 
interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format 
(specifically WSDL). Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by 
its description using SOAP-messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization
in conjunction with other Web-related standards." </programlisting>
