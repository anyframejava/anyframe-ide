		<partintro id="springrest_restintro_part_intro">
			<para>
				Before describing REST support functions provided by Spring using sample code of installed springrest plugin, 
				let's look into the concept of REST.
			</para>
			<para>
				REST, which is short for <emphasis role="bold">REpresentational State Transfer</emphasis>, 
				is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia system such as World Wide Web, 
				not a communication protocol, standard, or spec. 
				The term REST was first introduced in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, 
				It describes the <emphasis role="bold">communication between client and server on the network.</emphasis>

			<para>
				Now, let's look into what kinds of additional functions Spring 3 provides to implement services that apply 
				REST architecture described above, along with springrest plugin source code.
			</para>
			<para>
				Server-side support for building RESTful applications has been provided 
				as an extension of the existing annotation driven Spring MVC web framework. 
				There are various Annotations and HttpMessageConverters for HTTP Request/Response Body handling, 
				ViewResolver for Content Negotiation support, 
				Filter to use all HTTP methods, and RestTemplate that helps REST client application development.
