		  	<para>
		  		Developer can implement Reporting easily after developing business component 
		  		by providing tools that create Jasper XML(jrxml) file. JasperReports described in this manual 
		  		<ulink url="http://jasperforge.org/projects/jasperreports">(http://jasperforge.org/projects/jasperreports)</ulink> gives examples based on integration with Spring MVC. 
		  		The Reporting function provided by Anyframe basically provides JasperReports functions, 
		  		but because it is integrated with Spring MVC, 
		  		there can be some JasperReports functions that are not provided through Spring MVC. 
		  		In this case, an extended form of Spring MVC can be implemented if necessary.
		  	</para>
		
		  	<para>
		  		For instance, the following cases are included:
		  	</para>

		  	<itemizedlist>
		    	<listitem>
		      		<para>
		      			<emphasis role="bold">HTML file Reporting</emphasis> - 
		      			View class provided by Spring MVC is extended to display image file within HTML.
		      		</para>
		    	</listitem>
		  	</itemizedlist>

		  	<para>
		  		If you use the Reporting function after installing Anyframe, 
		  		you can use the above functions without additional coding when following the guidelines in this manual.
		  	</para>

	    	<para>
	    		Install JasperReports according to the following, design JRXML, and execute sample application.
