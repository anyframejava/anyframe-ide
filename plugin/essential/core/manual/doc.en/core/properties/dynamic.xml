	<title>Dynamic Reloading</title>
	<para>
		PropertiesService provides Dynamic Reload function for managed Property file (PropertiesService 4.2.0 onwards). 
		If you use Dynamic Reload, the change of property file monitored during system operation is identified and Reload is executed internally. 
		Thus the information on changed property can be read without restarting the server.
		
	</para>
	<para>
		To apply Dynamic Reload, 'dynamicReload' property should be defined additionally.

		<title>Note for using Dynamic Reload</title>
		<para>
			Note that the Dynamic Reload function is applied only to the Property File loaded through the file system 
			and not to individual properties that PropertiesService defined in XML or the Property File that exists in Classpath. 
			Also, since the properties previously loaded are cleared and new properties are reflected when Dynamic Reload is executed, 
			only the Property File based on the file system should be used, 
			not individual property definition and the Property File that exists in Classpath, 
			when the property of PropertiesService Bean is defined.
